TripSelector is an app that runs in Rails 7.

It takes a user's input parameters, or allows them to get a 'surprise'. It then autogenerates a travelling route across a country of their choice, to help them decide where to go for their next holiday.

It's available <a href="https://www.trips-selector.com/">here</a>, and is still in further dev stages.
